# List of GDPR Opt-Out Websites
## A list of websites that allow you to opt-out of ads and trackers.

Some notes:

* If you have an blocker of other cookie/script blocker (e.g., Ghostery. no-script etc.), ensure you "trust" the opt-out pages below otherwise the cookies can't be written.

* These opt-outs are "per browser" and "per device", if you use more than device, you have to repeat this process. If you use more than one browser, this has to be done on each browser. If you then "kill/delete" your cookies, you'll have to re-run this process as all adverts/tracking cookies are *always* on by default hence you must "opt-out" manually [*sigh*].

* What out for dark patterns [https://darkpatterns.org/], assume every click on these pages are designed to mislead you to accepting services you don't want.

* Advertisers/trackers share services across platforms so you masy find you've already optted out of a service when on the opt-out pages.
